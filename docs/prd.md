**Product Requirements Document: Model Guru**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-08
**Author:** [Your Name/AI Assistant]

**1. Introduction**

*   **1.1. Overview:** Model Guru is a web platform designed to be the central discovery hub for AI/ML models available via APIs and hosted platforms. It aggregates information from various sources, tracks key metrics like usage (runs) and popularity (likes/favorites), and presents curated lists of new, trending, and popular models.
*   **1.2. Problem Statement:** The AI model landscape is fragmented across numerous platforms (Replicate, Hugging Face, Stability AI, etc.) and expanding rapidly. Developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts struggle to keep track of newly released models, identify which models are gaining traction, and find the most popular or effective models for their needs without constantly monitoring multiple sources.
*   **1.3. Value Proposition:** Model Guru saves users time and effort by providing a single, consolidated view of the AI model ecosystem. It surfaces relevant models based on objective metrics and time-based trends, enabling faster discovery and informed decision-making.
*   **1.4. Goals:**
    *   Become the primary destination for discovering new and relevant AI models.
    *   Provide clear, actionable insights into model trends and popularity based on defined metrics.
    *   Establish trust and authority through transparent data aggregation and clear methodology.
    *   Offer a clean, intuitive user experience focused on efficient information discovery.
*   **1.5. Target Audience:**
    *   **Primary:** Indie Developers, AI/ML Engineers, Data Scientists, Researchers who actively use or search for AI models/APIs.
    *   **Secondary:** Product Managers, AI Enthusiasts, Tech Journalists seeking to stay updated on the AI landscape.

**2. Features**

**3. Design & UI/UX Considerations**

*   **3.1. Aesthetics:** Clean, modern, professional, data-centric design. Avoid clutter.
*   **3.2. Navigation:** Intuitive and simple main navigation. Easy discovery paths from homepage to lists to details.
*   **3.3. Responsiveness:** Fully responsive design for seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
*   **3.4. Performance:** Pages should load quickly. Data presentation should feel snappy. Optimize images and data loading.
*   **3.5. Clarity:** Ensure metrics, platform sources, and dates are clearly labeled and understandable. Use tooltips for potentially ambiguous terms or icons.
*   **3.6. Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines for accessibility (color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).

**4. Data Requirements (Conceptual)**

*   The system needs to store and manage data for:
    *   Platforms (Name, URL)
    *   Models (Name, Description, Platform ID, Source URL, Creator, Date Added, Tags)
    *   Metrics (Model ID, Timestamp, Run Count, Like Count)

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **5.1. Performance:** Core pages (Home, List, Detail) should load in under 3 seconds.
*   **5.2. Scalability:** Architecture should anticipate adding more platforms and handling increasing model/metric data volume over time.
*   **5.3. Reliability:** High uptime; data collection processes should be resilient to temporary source platform issues.
*   **5.4. Maintainability:** Codebase (ignored per request, but implied) should be well-structured for future updates. Data scraping/API integration needs monitoring for breakage.

**6. Release Criteria (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**

*   Homepage displaying "Newly Added" and "Most Popular (Likes) - Weekly" widgets for 1-2 core platforms (e.g., Hugging Face, Replicate).
*   Functional Model Listing page with basic filtering (Platform) and sorting (Date Added, Likes).
*   Functional Model Detail page showing basic info (Name, Desc, Source Link, Likes, Date Added).
*   Static About & Methodology pages.
*   Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
*   Weekly data updates are acceptable for MVP.

**7. Future Considerations**

*   User accounts (saving favorites, custom alerts).
*   Email digests/notifications for new/trending models.
*   Advanced filtering and search (e.g., license type, specific parameters).
*   Direct model comparison tools.
*   Historical trend charts on detail pages.
*   API access to Model Guru data.
*   Community features (comments, user ratings/tags).
*   Integration with more platforms.
*   Tracking fine-tuned versions of models.
*   More sophisticated "Trending" algorithms.

**8. Open Issues**

*   Final determination of which metrics are reliably available via API vs. scraping for each platform.
*   Precise algorithm definition for "Trending Score."
*   Exact data update frequency (Daily vs. Weekly vs. Hybrid).
*   Handling models present on multiple platforms (duplicates vs. distinct entries).
